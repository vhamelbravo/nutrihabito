Site for nutritionist offering their consultation services

Link to project: http://www.nutrihabito.cl

# How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This is a fully functional website for a nutritionist offering their services, it includes Contently's API inclusion, as well as a functional contact form using FormSubmit
# Lessons Learned:

This project was my first venture into using a CMD to help a client easily post new content, i used Contently since it seemed like the best option for my client's need, this is also the first site i made which had some API inclusion, which means that it's not purely focused on frontend, i had to look up Contently's manuals as well as general API concepts to make it work, so it has given me a greater understanding of how they work
